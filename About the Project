Designed a specialized device aimed at safeguarding the well-being of sanitation workers in manholes by measuring and monitoring the levels of harmful gases 
such as carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide. Recognizing the severe health risks faced by cleaners, the device assesses gas concentrations, and if they exceed a 
predetermined threshold, it prompts a safety delay. This innovative solution ensures that workers can wait for the gas levels to decrease before proceeding with 
cleaning, significantly reducing the potential health hazards associated with their crucial tasks.
